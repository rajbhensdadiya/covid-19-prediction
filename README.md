# COVID - 19 Cases Prediction

Build Machine Learning Model to Predict the Number of Confirm cases of Corona, Number of Death and Number of Recover Patients.
Used SVR algorithm to create Machine Learning Model, Used Flask framework for web page.
The problem COVID Case Prediction solves As the saying goes 'Prevention is always better than cure.' In the Existing Scenario we are only aware of the number of cases till date, but this model gives us the prediction about future cases of COVID-19 based on current situation. This can prove to be very helpful to the Government in a way, that they can take all the necessary steps needed to stop the pandemic from spreading more. This also helps in making all the necessary arrangements to fight against the pandemic. Also if the data is available to the common people they can be aware of the situation and play their role by staying at home.In the Existing Scenario we can only see the number of cases till the current date, but this project gives you the prediction of the future dates so that Government can take necessary steps to prevent the problem of COVID and it also provides you the helpline details and basic protective measures against the new coronavirus.

Challenges we ran into First and foremost as the COVID-19 virus is new we had a hard time finding dataset to train our model.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to Run project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to run the project.

```
Python 3
Anaconda (optional but Recommended)
```

## Running the Project

1. Open terminal / command prompt where python is installed.
2. Locate the Corona Virus Prediction folder.
3. type "python app.py" (without "").
4. There will be some address like 127.0.0.1:5000/ .
5. Copy it and open in Web Browser.
6. There will be input field type Date in DD/MM/YYYY format and You will get Prediction.
7. Go to terminal / command prompt and press ctrl + c to stop the project.
